what_Im_doing: "What, me? Well... I'm currently taking a <a
    href=\"https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=22862&pv_ano_lectivo=2022\">Master degree in
    Informatics and Computing Engineering</a> at
<a href=\"https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial\">Universidade do Porto</a>."

about_me: "<p>I'm from a small village in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelos,_Portugal\">Barcelos,
        Portugal</a>, where there's not much to do. Maybe I owe my 3 great passions to that.</p>
<p>Since I can remember I'm curious about how devices and machines we use in our everyday lives work. So I took every
    chance
    I could to help my father fix broken things around the house to learn and understand them. I love fixing things
    and I'm glad I don't always need my dad to fix them anymore.</p>
<p>Some years along the road I tried fixing the broken old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_4\">Pentium
        4</a> house computer and, gladly, it worked! I started to become very interested in how computers work and how
    they can help us either with useful software or by controlling and monitoring aspects of the physical world. My
    second passion was born! From that point on I help all my friend and family with computer related problems and
    perform maintence in their computers. I also try to keep informed about the latest hardware to provide them with
    buying advices.</p>
<p>Later, when dreaming of how to get around, I got into cars and car history, and, when I finnaly got my drivers'
    license, I learnt how to maintain my own. This is my most recent hobbie.</p>
<p>During my Bachelor degree (<a
        href=\"https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=22841&pv_ano_lectivo=2021\">Bachelor in
        Informatics and Computing Engineering</a> at
    <a href=\"https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial\">Universidade do Porto</a>) I became increasingly
    interested in low level software, IoT, embedded computing and software engineering and I hope I can learn more about
    this areas throughout my carreer and, who knows, conciliate them with my hobbies.
